# CS339 - Artificial Intelligence - Supervised Learning Project

The notebook to run the experiment described in paper is located at `./srcnn.ipynb`.

This repository is a forked from [Pytorch-enchance](https://github.com/isaaccorley/pytorch-enhance). The re-implementations of SRCNN variations are in the `torch_enchance/models/srcnn*.py` directory/files.

Trained models can be loaded from `weights/SRCNN_{#variation}/SRCNN_weight_{#epochs}.pt` directory/files.
